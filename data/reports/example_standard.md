WHR shows improving fundamentals despite macro headwinds. The company's cost-cutting initiatives are bearing fruit, and margin recovery is on track. However, housing market uncertainty creates downside risk.

### Bull Case

- **Cost restructuring**
  - Evidence: $200M savings target on track

### Bear Case
- **Housing slowdown**

  - Evidence: 2.5x debt/EBITDA ratio
- **Competitive pressure**
  - Evidence: Market share loss in mid-range segment

### Risk/Reward
- **Ratio:** 2.1
- **Upside Target:** $130
- **Downside Risk:** $90

### Confidence Assessment

Moderate confidence based on mixed signals. Strong internal execution but external macro factors create uncertainty. Evidence from Q4 earnings and management guidance supports the bull case, but housing market data could shift the thesis.
